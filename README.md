[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/AarishIrfan/postman-api-testing-suite)](https://github.com/AarishIrfan/postman-api-testing-suite/releases)



This repository demonstrates a complete setup for API testing using Postman, Newman CLI, CSV-based data-driven testing, HTML reporting, and CI automation with GitHub Actions. It is built around a weather API test suite and includes reusable scripts following best practices in software quality assurance.

---

## Project Goals

- Automate testing of RESTful API endpoints
- Use CSV iteration for efficient test coverage
- Validate responses with assertions
- Enable reusable logic via Postman package library
- Integrate testing with GitHub Actions CI

## Features

### Collection Tests
- HTTP GET requests for weather data
- Assertion checks for:
  - Status codes
  - Response time
  - JSON structure
  - Error handling
- Includes test for invalid city input and missing API key

### Data-Driven Testing
- Uses `weather_test_data.csv`
- Runs tests for multiple cities through iteration
- Validates logic for different use cases with one collection

### Reusable Script Modules
- Created centralized utility logic using `module.exports`
- Imported using `pm.require()` across multiple requests
- Follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Allows centralized update for shared logic

### Newman CLI Integration
- Automates local test execution via `npx newman run`
- Generates HTML report with `newman-reporter-html`
- Suitable for manual or scheduled testing workflows

### GitHub Actions CI
- `.github/workflows/newman-ci.yml` triggers test on push
- Runs collection with data file on GitHub-hosted runner
- Verifies results and logs test run output
- Helps detect failures on every commit or PR

## Test Reports

This repository contains the following HTML reports generated by Newman CLI:

- [Newman Test Report](newman-report.html) — Summary of test runs for Postman collection.
- [Postman Detailed Report](reports/postman_report.html) — Detailed test results for API endpoints.

You can open these files in any browser to review the test execution results and coverage.

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AarishIrfan/postman-api-testing-suite.git
cd postman-api-testing-suite
````

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install newman newman-reporter-html
```

### Run Tests Locally

```bash
npx newman run "PostAir Weather API - Baseline Test Suite.postman_collection.json" \
  --iteration-data "weather_test_data.csv" \
  --reporters cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export "newman-report.html"
```

## GitHub Actions CI Setup

This project includes a workflow to run the tests on every push to `main`.

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/newman-ci.yml`

* Uses `actions/checkout` and `node@20`
* Installs Newman
* Runs the Postman collection
* Uses CSV data
* Logs output to GitHub Actions runner logs

## Troubleshooting

**Push errors due to remote updates:**

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

**Missing Newman reporter:**

```bash
npm install newman-reporter-html
```

**PowerShell permission error (Windows):**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
